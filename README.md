## Notebook

<br>

## Usage

We chose to developp an application using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io), which is open-source and user-friendly Python framework. We made the app interface as simple as possible, while keeping a certain level of personalization. We deployed our app on [Streamlit Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud), which is free.
When the application is launched, the user must make choices from a number of filters. Then, he will submit his entries and can observe the corresponding results.
